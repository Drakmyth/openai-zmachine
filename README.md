# Z-Machine interpreter

Python implementation of a z-machine interpreter, for playing Infocom games. To play a z-machine file:

`python zmachine [GAME_FILE]`

The original Zork trilogy (written by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling) is in the `games` directory. The interpreter currently supports version 3 z-machine files only.

## Further notes

The [Z-Machine Standards Document](https://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html), by Graham Nelson, is an indispensable guide for decoding the z-machine instructions.
