# OpenAI Z-Machine interpreter

Running the `look` command in any game will generate a `generated_image.png` file in the root directory on disk using the description of that room as the AI prompt.

## Environment setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

## Run a game

```
> python3 zmachine ./games/ZORK1.z5
```
